There is a settlement and MOU between NARA and The Barack Obama Foundation that outlines the issues.

Obama's Presidential Center won't include ANY of the president's records, files, documents, or artifacts. In the past presidential records have been archived (electronically and physically) at the National Archives facilities in DC and Maryland. When a presidential library is built they are moved to the presidential library. NARA does not set up temporary storage facilities and scanning facilities hundreds of miles away from their facilities, infrastructure, and staff.

In this case, Obama didn't want NARA to be involved in his library whatsoever. He wanted to be in charge of scanning ALL of the documents. He didn't want NARA to do it. So the settlement he entered into with the National Archives is that his vendor will do all of the scanning - afterward they will send the digital files to the National Archives. Super sketchy. Check out the article, it is really detailed and includes links to settlements: [https://politiquerepublic.substack.com/p/obamas-effort-to-secure-his-presidential](https://politiquerepublic.substack.com/p/obamas-effort-to-secure-his-presidential)",2_1

NARA has made statements regarding the Obama documents and have made it clear that no laws were broken and that the documents from Obama's presidency are safe and secure.

It's definitely not as sketchy as keeping documents in a basement at a personal residence and refusing to give them up and lying about giving them up necessitating a raid by the FBI to recover those documents, some of which were at the highest classification possible.

The new NARA head is a Democrat political employee. NARA rank and file are pissed that Obama pulled his files out of the NARA facility to send them to Chicago. It was a ploy to get them out of NARA control. The legal settlement between NARA and Obama is outrageous, Obamas folks do the scanning and handling of all the documents. NARA folks are prevented from handling until after they are scanned. Then NARA staff arent allowed on the property of Obamas Presidential Center. The whole thing is really sketchy.

* 33M documents: Trump lied, it was only 30M documents
* Personally kept: They are in a NARA-controlled facility, Obama lives in DC
* Classified: Obama declassified the documents

The [article](https://politiquerepublic.substack.com/p/obamas-effort-to-secure-his-presidential) shares what Trump was reminding the media about - Obama's scheme to maintain control of his records and prevent NARA from crafting his legacy. Before Obama left the White House he ordered NARA to rent a furniture showroom in suburban Chicago. He then removed 30 million presidential records from the National Archives in DC against the wishes of NARA staffers. They complained that the furniture store wasn't a good place for the documents - they didn't have any staff there and it didn't have any infrastructure for scanning. They also complained that no one had reviewed the classification level of the documents - there were no doubt classified documents in the mix. Obama shut them down explaining that he wanted the digitization work to be done in Chicago and not DC AND he declassified all of the documents. When Trump took office NARA tried to get him to help them get the documents back to DC telling him that there were classified documents in the mix. Trump said he wasn't going to get in the middle of the conflict.

This means that every single bit needs to go to something useful so that you get at least one decent balanced meal daily while ensuring the cost per day to eat will stretch. If you waste food you go hungry. If you buy expensive items you will also go hungry because you are wasting the funds given to you in an unwise manner. The restrictions and punishments are built right into it.

So if you decide filet mignon is on the menu and buy it then prepare to starve at the end of the month.

They pulled out every stop to investigate the Trump Administration for Russian collusion. They did the same for the January 6th commission and so on and so on. All of which not only found nothing to support their claims but instead exposed the levels of corruption behind these kangaroo courts. Democracy dies when the voters no longer believe that their vote counts. Our current representation in DC has failed us time and time again. We need fresh blood that is not tangled up in the web of political corruption. Both sides of the isle need to clean house and start holding our elected officials accountable.

Second............... Dinesh D'Souza's 2000 mules and Mike Lindell endless hours of video already did ""prove it"".

Third...... people already have done jail time for rigging the election for the democrats.

Fourth.... There is already courtroom proof that the democratic party does in fact rig elections:

The democrats already rigged one modern day election. Hillary stole the democratic nomination for president from Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders took the democratic party to court because he knew his nomination was stolen by Hillary and at the end of the trial the judge looked at the evidence and looked directly at Bernie Sanders and said ""The democratic party did in fact steal your nomination from you but since there is no law for stealing an election within a party there is nothing I can do.""

So there is already courtroom proof that the democrats do in fact rig and steal elections as close as 2016.

Immediately upon removal of the President, fhe VP is sworn.   ( see LBJ, Ford) The new president then nominates a new VP.   Historically, congress practically rubber stamps the nomination as long as the nominee qualifies.

What youre suggesting is that house republicans would have the political power to hold up Harris's nominee vote while they instead focus on impeachment while leaving the office of VP empty?   With the American people that goes over like explosive diarrhea in church.

He let the cdc de facto rule through proclamations and edicts. He can virtue signal that he was anti mandate all he wants. But everything from eviction bans and teachers unions ruling from on high started when we was in office. And he did nothing to stop it. This is why he lost. Fauci shouldve been fired by September 2020. He had already flip flopped on various things a dozen times.,2

This is as dumb a take as most of the anti-Musk trolls.  The Ukrainian official's statement was childish, but so was Musk's.

'Repositioning the satellites' also shows a complete lack of understanding of how Starlink works.  No orbits have been changed to cover Ukraine.  SpaceX provided user terminals and has been doing constant troubleshooting to keep ahead of Russian hacking.  Some of this cost has been covered by the US and other governments, but they have been bearing a good deal themselves.  


Asking for some support was perfectly reasonable, but Musk managed to squander any good will and make himself look like a petulant child.  The media has, of course, been running with the story and incorrect timeline.  It's a shame that DeSantis is too.",2

I support Desantis, and his Trump-policies-minus-the-Trump-personality are going to be super popular if he is put on a national stage, where people will hear him describe them directly, unfiltered by the media.

Unlike the dollar and the traditional finance system, the crypto world has no rules. There are quite literally thousands upon thousands of hackers, unethical people, and outright con artists who would break the system to steal it all for themselves if they could. It's a hostile environment. In traditional finance, people don't steal because they will go to jail if they steal. In crypto, scammers are simply not caught. 

And yet, despite all of this, the fundamental systems that prevent abuse work. If you transfer bitcoin from wallet A to wallet B, it will get there. The cryptographic math that protects the various blockchains is stronger than the cryptographics used to protect our nation's military infrastructure, and in numerous occasions its stronger than that used to protect banks. 

Now, everything on top of that layer 1 is of course scam city. But that core layer 1 has so far proven to be unbreakable after 10 years and quite literally a bounty on cracking it that's worth more than 1 billion dollars.",2_1_1_1

Crypto is volatile, with downside risk as much as upside risk. Its a question of human psychology just as much as economics. The question of course comes down to macro economics. Lets say the us dollar remains the world reserve currency and biden somehow manages to get inflation under control. Then, crypto will go through another cycle where it crashes. As such, its a bad investment in the medium term. 

But let's say that the democrats retain control of the whitehouse in 2024, and inflation keeps rising. Then we run into serious problems. 

I think the economy is in between a rock and a hard place. look at negative interest rates that are existing in europe. They have to take money out of the system. In theory, it could be done in the us with draconian wealth taxes, (provided the dollars were burned instead of used to fund the government) 

However all of these solutions just strengthen the crypto proposition of sound money. Which is why hillary is afraid of it.",3_1

 But my question was about this post.

Considering 45 got five deferments while working for his dad and making money, and on the subject of military, he hired Kelly (fired), McMaster (fired), Mattis (fired), and would have fired Milley if he could, I am wondering whether it's wise for us to be talking about trump as military guy. I mean, he could have served, right.? Maybe talk about him was a business guy.

the only general who survived was Flynn for like a month, but he got convicted. Taking secret money from the dictator Erdogan while reversing our Turkish policy, sitting next to Putin at the RT Dinner and the undercutting our sanctions policy and got caught lying about it on a wiretap.

Trump pardoned him. I agree: the man is a patriot, right?

I know George Washington mortgaged Mt. Vernon to pay the Continental Army. I could see Trump doing the same thing!!! He's that kind of guy. A real patriot!

PS: I also think that Trump was absolutely right to politely ask that rat Comey not to pursue charges against Flynn because Flynn was a good guy.

He is a brilliant businessman who has had multiple chances to sit back and enjoy a fortune, but has, instead, let it ride and sunk his time and money into new, highly speculative projects.  


That said, the guy just needs to learn when to SHUT UP.  Cheap, reliable access to space is vastly important for the future of America and humanity and there are a million ways, big and small, in which government can kill SpaceXs projects.  He needs to stop antagonizing the likes of Sanders and Warren, who are either too uninformed or too dishonest to understand the repercussions of what they are doing or how fundamentally different SpaceX is from other, superficially similar new space ventures that produce little but tourist flights and shiny graphics (mostly at taxpayer expense).


He's trying to outtroll the trolls.  Problem is, though, that these trolls have the power to smash his dreams in the real world if they get pissed enough or think that their bases will reward them for doing so.",2

Obviously every fetus isnt going to be viable or sold but this is the size of the industry.

Doesnt mean I am pro-life. As a Republican I also see the immediate need for senate and congressional term limits. I think that those both Republican and Democratic in office are sitting pretty on the backs and labors of their constituents and living large while those in their districts suffer. I want to see my States Republicans and Democrats senators and congress people replaced. They have been there too long. All of them. They have made a living off of the office. That is not in the American peoples best interest. They live large and well. Not in Pelosis state but her bragging on having ice cream with her 3 $30,000.00 fridge/frezeers in her kitchen. Why is that allowed?  I think term limits need to be established to keep the elected honest and true. That way they have 4 years to prove their worth 4 more. If they dont prove it elect someone else. 

Now it is no one will run against the big man because they cant win due to the man having backing by big money. If we implemented term limits.  The backing would be for new people and the public would be able to determine who was true and who was a paid hand. 

Who else feels this way?  Republicans and Democrats?  I want to know?",3

Trump's Executive Order frozen, not revoked. And it would have affected a limited amount of people, and was opposed by the people who would enact it as inefficient and costly.   
Build Back Better caps insulin cost for all public and private insurance holders.  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The executive order, which was signed by Trump on July 24, 2020, was frozen, not revoked.  Such a freeze is also not unusual for an incoming administration: Trumps chief of staff Reince Priebus issued a similar memorandum on January 20, 2017. If implemented, it will require that Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) -- which serve about one in 11 Americans, including homeless and vulnerable populations -- offer the discounted price they receive when they purchase insulin and injectable epinephrine (EpiPens) through a federal program called 340B. The freeze was welcomed by the National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC).  Health centers are already part of the solution to this problem, and the regulation would have burdened them with excessive red tape without doing anything to lower how much drug companies charge for drugs. Such a rule could decrease the amount of money available for other services.

  
Among the Build Back Better bill's many drug price provisions is one that would set a $35 monthly cap on insulin for Medicare beneficiaries and those with private insurance.",2

Both have their hand in the honey pot. Inflation doesnt happen overnight, it takes months and years for the effects of a nation wide lockdown to have negative effects on the economy.

These two clown politicians, Newsom and Kamala, must revel in their impotence at solving the problems they were elected to solve. They are both publicly stating that they are so inept and incompetent that a man who left office almost two years ago is preventing them from doing their jobs.

By blaming President Trump they are really telling the public that they do not want to solve the crisis because it was they who created the crisis. They blame President Trump so the legal U.S. citizens in this country can go through as much hurt and damage as possible from the two crises. A smaller tax base does hurt the people who stay in California.

This is really the hallmark of democratic politicians. They absolutely refuse to feel the pain of the people they represent. Lightfoot is another perfect example of this.

[PolicenDomesticnAbuse](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Police-domestic-violence-nearly-twice-average-rate-2536928.php) 

In the last 9 years US police [raped](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2018/10/19/us/police-sexual-assaults-maryland-scope/index.html) over 400 people in custody.

In 2017 police killed [1000](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/nationwide-police-shot-and-killed-nearly-1000-people-in-2017/2018/01/04/4eed5f34-e4e9-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html%3foutputType=amp)  people in the US.

&gt;Police officers are indicted in fewer than 1% of killings, but the indictment rate for civilians involved in a killing is 90%. (FiveThirtyEight)

&gt;In 2015, there were 1,307 people who lost their lives at the hands of a police officer or law enforcement official. In 2016, that number was 1,152. Although lower, both years are still higher than the 1,149 people who were killed by police in 2014. (Fatal Encounters/Mapping Police Violence

&gt;52% of police officers report that it is not unusual for law enforcement officials to turn a blind eye to the improper conduct of other officers. (US Department of Justice)

&gt;61% of police officers state that they do not always report serious abuse that has been directly observed by fellow officers. (US Department of Justice)

&gt;84% of police officers have stated in a recent survey that they have directly witnesses a fellow officer using more force than was necessary. (US Department of Justice)

&gt;People who are African-American/Black are twice as likely to be killed by a police officer while being unarmed compared to a Caucasian/White individual. (The Guardian)

&gt;1 in 4 people who are killed by law enforcement officials in the United States are unarmed. (Mic)

&gt; The second most common form of police misconduct is sexual assault

&gt;This isn't debatable, actually look at the facts](https://www.vox.com/identities/2016/8/13/17938186/police-shootings-killings-racism-racial-disparities)

&gt;An analysis of the available FBI data by [Dara Lind for Vox](http://www.vox.com/2014/8/21/6051043/how-many-people-killed-police-statistics-homicide-official-black) found that US police kill black people at disproportionate rates: Black people accounted for 31 percent of police killing victims in 2012, even though they made up just 13 percent of the US population. 

&gt;The disparities appear to be even starker for unarmed suspects, according to an analysis of 2015 police killings by the [Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/black-americans-killed-by-police-analysis). Racial minorities made up about 37.4 percent of the general population in the US and 46.6 percent of armed and unarmed victims, but they made up 62.7 percent of unarmed people killed by police.

&gt;These disparities in police use of force reflect more widespread racial inequities across the entire American criminal justice system. Black people are much more likely to be [arrested for drugs](http://www.vox.com/cards/war-on-drugs-marijuana-cocaine-heroin-meth/war-on-drugs-effect), even though theyre not more likely to [use](http://www.vox.com/2014/7/27/5940783/prohibition-marijuana-legalization-pot-weed-racism-new-york-times) or [sell](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2871399/) them. And black inmates make up a disproportionate amount of the [prison population](http://www.vox.com/cards/everything-prisons-reform-incarceration-criminal-justice/what-are-the-demographics-of-the-prison-population).


[Another study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0141854)

&gt;from 2015, by researcher Cody Ross found, There is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates), meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates. That suggests that, again, other factors are involved in the disparities seen for these shootings.",2_2_1_1_1_1_1_1

1. We generally all have a government issued ID in the form of our health card.

2. The list of forms of acceptable voter ID is extremely extensive. Basically any id issued by any government agency, including a library card, is acceptable.

3. You dont actually need an id as long as you get somebody with an id to vouch for you.

If Republicans proposed voter id laws along the lines of that framework, it might actually get passed. Instead we see things like the North Carolina attempt, where there was a documented deliberate effort to exclude certain types of ids based on the race / political affiliation of the typical holder. 

Also, voter id laws do nothing to stop mail in voting fraud, which is what everybody is complaining about.

Finally, I think the idea that the government needs a really good reason to limit your ability to engage in a constitutional right really friggin cool. Its why Im against a lot of feel-good not actually helpful gun legislation. The idea that the government would inconvenience everybody to stop a problem they cant show really exists by implementing laws that wouldnt actually stop that problem is pretty lame of you guys.",2

****Minimum Age for Gun Possession: Subject to limited exceptions*, federal law prohibits the possession of a handgun or handgun ammunition by any person under the age of 18. Federal law provides no minimum age for the possession of long guns or long gun ammunition.*****

Hmmmm. I guess I was wrong about the federal law? 

Federal law provides no minimum age for the possession of long guns or long gun ammunition ARE YOU KIDDING ME? a 10yo kid can possess a rifle or shotgun and its not against federal law?

But what does the STATE law say? 

Children over 12 and under 16 are allowed to use rifles and shotguns under very limited, supervised situations.[11]

They totally skipped 17? There's no info here about 17, you're still one year away from legally buying it yourself?

I guess we can assume it's OK bc it's not listed or vague-ish.

Seems to be a grey area...... I guess that's why the judge dismissed the gun charges.


Under Wisconsin law, anyone under 18 who possesses a dangerous weapon is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to nine months behind bars.


Uh oh! 

But Rittenhouses attorneys seized on a subsection of the Wisconsin law that states the ban on minors possessing dangerous weapons applies to minors armed with rifles or shotguns only if those weapons are short-barreled. The language stems from a bill that then-Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson signed in 1991. Lawmakers across the country were trying to find ways to curb gang violence around that time. Kenosha defense attorney Michael Cicchini said the law was likely intended to prevent youths from carrying sawed-off shotguns.

Rittenhouses AR-15-style rifle was not short-barreled.

powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many

would explain the power of whats going to happen and
he was rightwho would have thought?), but when you
look at whats going on with the four prisonersnow it
used to be three, now its fourbut when it was three and
even now, I would have said its all in the messenger;
fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they dont, they
