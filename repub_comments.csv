"2","Yeah they were removed by NARA to their location in Chicago to be gone through in order to set up Obama's Presidential library.  This is what normal presidents have done since the 1950s."
"3","The article is pretty detailed explaining what actually happened. There is a settlement and MOU between NARA and The Barack Obama Foundation that outlines the issues.

Obama's Presidential Center won't include ANY of the president's records, files, documents, or artifacts. In the past presidential records have been archived (electronically and physically) at the National Archives facilities in DC and Maryland. When a presidential library is built they are moved to the presidential library. NARA does not set up temporary storage facilities and scanning facilities hundreds of miles away from their facilities, infrastructure, and staff.

In this case, Obama didn't want NARA to be involved in his library whatsoever. He wanted to be in charge of scanning ALL of the documents. He didn't want NARA to do it. So the settlement he entered into with the National Archives is that his vendor will do all of the scanning - afterward they will send the digital files to the National Archives. Super sketchy. Check out the article, it is really detailed and includes links to settlements: [https://politiquerepublic.substack.com/p/obamas-effort-to-secure-his-presidential](https://politiquerepublic.substack.com/p/obamas-effort-to-secure-his-presidential)"
"4","Not that sketchy.  NARA has made statements regarding the Obama documents and have made it clear that no laws were broken and that the documents from Obama's presidency are safe and secure. I trust them over ""politiquerepublic.substack.com.""  

It's definitely not as sketchy as keeping documents in a basement at a personal residence and refusing to give them up and lying about giving them up necessitating a raid by the FBI to recover those documents, some of which were at the highest classification possible.  That's illegal and highly dangerous to national security and should be punished."
"5","We can agree to disagree. The new NARA head is a Democrat political employee. NARA rank and file are pissed that Obama pulled his files out of the NARA facility to send them to Chicago. It was a ploy to get them out of NARA control. The legal settlement between NARA and Obama is outrageous, Obamas folks do the scanning and handling of all the documents. NARA folks are prevented from handling until after they are scanned. Then NARA staff arent allowed on the property of Obamas Presidential Center. The whole thing is really sketchy. You dont have to trust me, read the New York Times article linked in the article. They called Obama out hard for the sketchy nature of the deal."
"6","Not as outrageous as keeping them unsecured in a basement and lying to the FBI about them. 

Oh and the head of the FBI is a Republican political employee."
"7","Turns out that the building is secured by dozens of heavily armed secret service agents. And what are you claiming Trump lied about?"
"8","Echo-chamber&"
"9","https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/aug/12/donald-trump/why-trump-wrong-suggest-obama-personally-kept-33-m/

Sooo.. that was a lie...."
"10","It is interesting to watch the mental gymnastics the mainstream media fact checkers go through to debunk former President Trump. 

* 33M documents: Trump lied, it was only 30M documents
* Personally kept: They are in a NARA-controlled facility, Obama lives in DC
* Classified: Obama declassified the documents

The [article](https://politiquerepublic.substack.com/p/obamas-effort-to-secure-his-presidential) shares what Trump was reminding the media about - Obama's scheme to maintain control of his records and prevent NARA from crafting his legacy. Before Obama left the White House he ordered NARA to rent a furniture showroom in suburban Chicago. He then removed 30 million presidential records from the National Archives in DC against the wishes of NARA staffers. They complained that the furniture store wasn't a good place for the documents - they didn't have any staff there and it didn't have any infrastructure for scanning. They also complained that no one had reviewed the classification level of the documents - there were no doubt classified documents in the mix. Obama shut them down explaining that he wanted the digitization work to be done in Chicago and not DC AND he declassified all of the documents. When Trump took office NARA tried to get him to help them get the documents back to DC telling him that there were classified documents in the mix. Trump said he wasn't going to get in the middle of the conflict.

"11","Politifact is a not for profit prganization who's only goal is discerning whether or not the claims and statements made by politicians on both side of the aisle are factual or true. Politique Republic is some guys blog. You tell me which is more likely to be telling the truth."
"12","Politifact didnt contradict the article. The articled merely provided context that explained why Trump said what he said. As for the bias of Politifact it is a far left media outlet that fact checks conservatives 10X as often as liberals. They even fact check conservative opinions. 

Poynter took over operation of PolitiFact in 2018 to make it easier for the site to solicit charitable donors for support of its work. PolitiFact says that it receives administrative support, but no money, from Poynter, and is reliant on advertising sales and donations from foundations, corporations, and individuals. Since 2013, Democracy Fund has donated more than $1,000,000 to PolitiFact. 

An independent 2013 analysis from the nonpartisan Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University concluded that PolitiFact was three times as likely to rank statements from Republicans as Pants on Fire, and twice as likely to rank statements from Democrats as Entirely True."
"13","Did they rate how often the site was correct in their analysis (literally the only meaningful metric)?"
"14","Yep& it is well known they focus on debunking conservatives. They admit this. For example, they rated Obamas claim that you could keep your insurance and doctor if you wanted as true even though they admitted they knew it was impossible."
"15","!maybe they debunk conservatives more often because conservatives need to lie constantly."

"20","The socialists want to keep you in line by having you live in fear of your government.  A great way to do that is to have a private agency (unlike police incident and arrest reports, IRS audits are not public) that can be used a secret weapon because every adult must file a return with that agency.  No coincidence that shortly after this passed the senate, the FBI announced a search warrant for Trump, a propaganda move so the ""defund and disarm the police"" movement get tricked info funding armed tax police because they are seen as going after the enemies of the socialists, when in fact, as we have seen with Siema and Manchim, they will turn on their own that don't support them too."

I really don't think he fits well in either party."
"26","That was kinda my point. The Trumpsters out here pretending that he's the only real republican but that label doesn't fit great"
"27","The correct label would be ""opportunist"" I think."
"28","Probably an unpopular opinion on here, but I hope that a republican other than trump wins in 2024. Granted, I would much rather have trump over any democrat (with the exception of Tulsi Gabbard), but, there are better republican candidates who could probably run the show better"

"40","I didnt say anything about what they said. Im talking about what Joe Biden said.

"71","How is this an appropriate way to spend SNAP dollars?  It's NOT!  This is insane."
"72","It's the system that boomer fought for to leave us because government cheese wasn't good enough"
"73","Bizzare conversation"
"74","Nevertheless true. The boomers didn't want people going to the church to get food or to get low quality Government food so they came up with food stamps allowing the poor to get lobster with them"
"75","Any evidence for this?

Do all churches give out food?

At $1.40 SNAP per meal, do you think they are buying lobster?

Since you love churches so much, did Jesus Christ ever say or do anything about feeding the poor? What would He have thought about you?

How's this? ""He said also to the man who had invited him, When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid. But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.

Luke 14:12-14

Do you think you have thought this thing through? Are you just?"
"76","Womp womp womp

Live fish such as lobsters and other shellfish may be purchased with SNAP benefits. Pumpkins are edible and eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits. However, inedible gourds and pumpkins that are used solely for ornamental purposes are not eligible items.

What does the Bible say about taking money from people at gun point with the threat of jail to feed someone when you are struggling to feed yourself? 

I believe they call that theft and the Bible condemn it. Now if it were voluntary contributions the Bible would be on your side"
"77","People who struggling to feed themself do not pay income taxes."
"78","No they send people with guns to take from you to make it so you struggle to feed yourself at 50k a year you are starting to get it"
"79","Please call your elected officials in the House and Senate and complain. The more voices they hear, the more likely they are to change this. SNAP EBT is accepted at fast food restaurants and that is not what this program was supposed to do."
"80","How many full nutritious meals can you put on the table for $32?"

"83","...as my bank balance goes down...from all the tax increases..."
"84","Wait till I get my transition paid for by your taxes too. Muahahaha!"
"85","You need to stop /s. I've read your comment history. I offered a $95/hour job to a trans woman who declined because she was ""high on an edible"" that day, and already received tax-payer assistance will full medical and hormone treatments. ""It was hard but I did it!""."
"86","No kidding"
"87","SNAP dollars are a large driver of food inflation as well as everything else. There has been an unnatural and absurd amount of food money pumped out of DC into the hands of the less wealthy. We're talking people with THOUSANDS on their EBT cards. Before Covid, it was supplementary so families still had to be smart with it. Now it's an all-you-can-eat more money than you can fit into your kitchen."
"88","[According to the USDA](https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs), 30-40 percent of food is wasted. When you don't earn the money for your food, I'd speculate the waste is even larger in those homes. Like when you go to an all-you-can-eat buffet and you see people leaving half the food for the busser."
"89","Since you have to speculate I'm going to assume you've never been knocked low enough in life to have to shamefully go beg Uncle Sam for some food. I'm not saying you're wrong as on the whole you may be correct, but from personal experience absolutely not. The meager amount of money you get you have to plan a month's worth of food around. This means that every single bit needs to go to something useful so that you get at least one decent balanced meal daily while ensuring the cost per day to eat will stretch. If you waste food you go hungry. If you buy expensive items you will also go hungry because you are wasting the funds given to you in an unwise manner. The restrictions and punishments are built right into it.

So if you decide filet mignon is on the menu and buy it then prepare to starve at the end of the month. The amount of frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts you could have bought with that money would have kept you fed, but because of poor choices you're now unable to feed yourself. Isn't that great? Freedom to make stupid choices and reaping the rewards is about the most American thing I can think of. Let them. We'll sit here laughing knowing those fools will be on the ropes in the 3rd and 4th weeks of the month."
"90","Do you think that major corporations that sell to the program would be delighted to see this business evaporate? Do you think that the dividends, capital gains, and stock buybacks they enjoy go to the ""less wealthy""? Do you think they buy senators from the farm states?  


Why are SNAP dollars are ""large"" driver of food inflation?"
"91","It's the amount of money being injected into the grocery markets driving demand unnaturally high for product that doesn't normally sell this quickly. Couple that with fuel costs and everything else prices go up."
"92","Good try but wrong. You ought to read more about SNAP before spreading misinformation. The SNAP budget, by law, declines when economic times are good. It rises when they are bad. So it's counter-recessionary.  The products you described really don't change year over year so the demand is what it is.

Fuel costs? Spot on. Blame Russia. Grain costs? Yup. Blame Russia.

did you know that real wages adjusted for inflation are what they were in 1976? That's after 40 years of tax cuts overwhelmingly for the rich. The GINI coefficient has risen to absurd levels in that time. You probably don't know what that is. You owe it to yourself to learn.

The Federal Budget is $6 trillion. The SNAP budget is $120 billion. that's 2 percent. It's also 1/2 of one percent of our GNP.

I'd love to hear your expert economic analysis about how such tiny numbers ""drive inflation"".

Ever think about the Defense budget? Is every penny wisely spent?

They did the same for the January 6th commission and so on and so on. All of which not only found nothing to support their claims but instead exposed the levels of corruption behind these kangaroo courts. Democracy dies when the voters no longer believe that their vote counts. Our current representation in DC has failed us time and time again. We need fresh blood that is not tangled up in the web of political corruption. Both sides of the isle need to clean house and start holding our elected officials accountable. However none of that is even possible if our election process is continuously being corrupted."

"119","First............ I've spent to much time in combat zones for you or anyone else to call me ""snowflake"".

Second............... Dinesh D'Souza's 2000 mules and Mike Lindell endless hours of video already did ""prove it"".

Third...... people already have done jail time for rigging the election for the democrats.

Fourth.... There is already courtroom proof that the democratic party does in fact rig elections:

The democrats already rigged one modern day election. Hillary stole the democratic nomination for president from Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders took the democratic party to court because he knew his nomination was stolen by Hillary and at the end of the trial the judge looked at the evidence and looked directly at Bernie Sanders and said ""The democratic party did in fact steal your nomination from you but since there is no law for stealing an election within a party there is nothing I can do.""

"129","idk, i have a hard time believing trumps election claims just because theres been over 60 different court cases (including trump appointed judges) that have all lost and found no evidence of fraud or tampering. 

also worth noting that even newsmax has to disclaim that the election wasnt stolen.

""Newsmax subsequently found no evidence that such allegations were true. Many of the states whose results were contested by the Trump campaign after the November 2020 election have conducted extensive recounts and audits, and each of these states certified the results as legal and final,""


statement from newsmax. 


everything just kinda points to the fact that most americans voted for biden. democracy is democracy. i think the election was fair, even if that meant the best candidate didnt win."
"130","Sadly our president is Biden. The claim that 60 different court cases found no evidence of fraud or tampering is misleading because almost all of them were denied on the basis of standing - they never reviewed any evidence - litigation would have taken months if not years. The real issue with the election relate to the Zuck Bucks injected into swing states that caused election officials to violate elections laws passed in at least six states without any approval from the states legislatures."

"212","Do you really want a President Harris?"
"213","We can deal with her via impeachment."
"214","And then you would be looking at President Pelosi."
"215","Nah, this would be after the mid-terms so whoever the GOP SOH is at that time."
"216","Youre both incorrect.

Immediately upon removal of the President, fhe VP is sworn.   ( see LBJ, Ford) The new president then nominates a new VP.   Historically, congress practically rubber stamps the nomination as long as the nominee qualifies.

What youre suggesting is that house republicans would have the political power to hold up Harris's nominee vote while they instead focus on impeachment while leaving the office of VP empty?   With the American people that goes over like explosive diarrhea in church.

The only path for SotH to be sworn in is if both the President and the VP are simultaneously dead."
"217","Senate Republicans held up a Supreme Court nominee for a year, I see no reason to believe they wouldn't hold up a VP nominee as well. Especially in a 50-50 Senate with no tiebreaker. Post mid-term, if the GOP wins, what benefit would there be to confirming Harris VP nomination if the next in line is the Republican Speaker? I'm not sure the public cares that much about the VP office being held by someone and in the polarized political world we live in there may be a significant backlash against Republicans allowing a vote or voting for her nominee. This is all speculative of course, Biden isn't going to be removed via the 25th amendment."
"218","Agreed on speculation.

But dont underestimate the media machine that would go into full leftist meltdown over not taking up their constitutional duty to confirm the VP nomination.   The turtle would never allow all of that to happen."
"219","I don't doubt the media would circle the wagons for the VP nominee. That said, I'm not sure the mainstream press is as powerful as they think they are. They've been able to scare everyone over Covid but outside of Covid no one really listens to them, particularly on political matters. Republicans outright reject them and moderates seem to be wise to their implicit leftwing bias, even if they're in agreement some of the time. 

At the end of the day I guess all that matters is who the nominee is. If it's, for example, Joe Manchin there isn't going to be any support for blocking him. If it's Chuck Schumer or Bernie Sanders there would be support for blocking such a nominee."
"220","This just seems ridiculous, wait until the next election and vote him out if you dont like him, dont destroy the country just to install a Republican."
"221","I don't necessarily disagree but we're having a speculative discussion about what might happen not necessarily what should happen."
"222","Its HRC"
"223","If HRC was nominated for VP there is no doubt in my mind that every single Republican would line up against her. Also, she wouldn't accept the nomination. She would primary Harris and probably beat her."
"224","Even then, if the House voted to impeach her, the Senate would need to convict for a president to be removed from office. That requires a two-thirds majority vote, which isn't going to happen."

"260","Oh, good grief.  This is as dumb a take as most of the anti-Musk trolls.  The Ukrainian official's statement was childish, but so was Musk's.  SpaceX asked the DoD to start picking up part of the tab over a month ago.  This was not cause and effect.



'Repositioning the satellites' also shows a complete lack of understanding of how Starlink works.  No orbits have been changed to cover Ukraine.  SpaceX provided user terminals and has been doing constant troubleshooting to keep ahead of Russian hacking.  Some of this cost has been covered by the US and other governments, but they have been bearing a good deal themselves.  


Asking for some support was perfectly reasonable, but Musk managed to squander any good will and make himself look like a petulant child.  The media has, of course, been running with the story and incorrect timeline.  It's a shame that DeSantis is too."

"299","What has me so scared is that Democrats only need one charismatic, semi-competent figurehead to unite the left, like Trump did with the right in 2016, and they will be unstoppable. But it is also so hilarious that they cannot find one. Every Democrat who is in a position to run for president is either a babbling buffoon or universally hated in Democrat circles, or both."
"300","This honestly surprises me. With Bidens ratings, health and general capacity I don't know why they wouldn't want to try and push him out the door"
"301","They will, but Hillary is probably the only potential Democrat candidate more hated by Democrat voters than Biden. I think they will run Buttigieg in 2024, although I don't think it will matter who they run, if Biden (or his puppemasters, at least) don't turn around the economy soon."
"302","I don't think he's doing a poor job but I agree that he is too old to continue in office. Being president is a very stressful job so it would be best if we could get a younger person in there. Having a president pass away while in office has always opened a can of worms."
"303","At this point, I'm 80% sure the 2024 Dem candidate will be Buttigieg. Not only is he the only one who is not insane, but Biden's recent speech talking up his leadership abilities, and his admin's refusal to state whether Biden will run again, has me strongly suspecting it will be him. The only reason they wouldn't run him would be to spare his reputation for 2028, because if Biden doesn't turn things around quick, 2024 is going to be a bloodbath for Dems, no matter who they run.

Now the only question is whether Republicans will run Trump or Desantis. I support Desantis, and his Trump-policies-minus-the-Trump-personality are going to be super popular if he is put on a national stage, where people will hear him describe them directly, unfiltered by the media. But I think Trump will be nominated, because I think Desantis wants to stay in Florida (as a Floridian, I kind of want him to, as well), and he doesn't have the name-recognition that Trump does."

"338","Leftist people can certainly be hypocritical, but I think that can be said for a lot of people. This fixation on groups like it's just one group that is doing all the wrong in the world is the real issue. I will eagerly call out those that do it regardless of their or my political affiliation. And I will critique even the news/talking points that seemingly fit my world view for their authenticity/validity. 

I browse both liberal and conservative subs because I have some overlapping opinions and tend to be more of a centrist. It doesn't matter which I might be on, if my observations go against the grain, the angry commentors and spam downvotes tend to come out in about 80-90% of cases. On one side they're calling me a Trump supporting racist, on the other they're calling me an angry marxist. Even when what I said has nothing to do with either of those two things, they just use those terms to represent anything they don't like.

"341","I was completely against crypto, but the more the democrats crack down on it, the more I support it. I'm still not super confident, but if the Biden administration is trying to get rid of it, it must have more pros than cons"
"342","Why are you against it? There are a lot of perspectives when it comes to crypto, as well as misinformation and the usual scam artist crowd."
"343","I'm going to be honest, I don't really have a good answer for you. Just something in me doesn't have a lot of faith in crypto(although my faith in the US dollar is waning). However, I do recognise that it is active a bit as a level against the federal reserve in a way, and if its what the people want, I'm not going to get in the way. Who knows, if the dollar keeps down the way its been going, my trust in Crypto vs the USD might start to resemble the Biden approval rating"
"344","Mmmm gotcha. Well, here is some food for thought. Unlike the dollar and the traditional finance system, the crypto world has no rules. There are quite literally thousands upon thousands of hackers, unethical people, and outright con artists who would break the system to steal it all for themselves if they could. It's a hostile environment. In traditional finance, people don't steal because they will go to jail if they steal. In crypto, scammers are simply not caught. 

And yet, despite all of this, the fundamental systems that prevent abuse work. If you transfer bitcoin from wallet A to wallet B, it will get there. The cryptographic math that protects the various blockchains is stronger than the cryptographics used to protect our nation's military infrastructure, and in numerous occasions its stronger than that used to protect banks. 

Now, everything on top of that layer 1 is of course scam city. But that core layer 1 has so far proven to be unbreakable after 10 years and quite literally a bounty on cracking it that's worth more than 1 billion dollars."
"345","That means you should buy as much as you can afford."
"346","I wouldn't say that. Crypto is volatile, with downside risk as much as upside risk. Its a question of human psychology just as much as economics. The question of course comes down to macro economics. Lets say the us dollar remains the world reserve currency and biden somehow manages to get inflation under control. Then, crypto will go through another cycle where it crashes. As such, its a bad investment in the medium term. 

But let's say that the democrats retain control of the whitehouse in 2024, and inflation keeps rising. Then we run into serious problems. 

I think the economy is in between a rock and a hard place. look at negative interest rates that are existing in europe. They have to take money out of the system. In theory, it could be done in the us with draconian wealth taxes, (provided the dollars were burned instead of used to fund the government) 

However all of these solutions just strengthen the crypto proposition of sound money. Which is why hillary is afraid of it."
"347","She'll find a way to make it work"
"348","Thats the point.jpg"
"349","Crypto is better than a one world paper currency that the globalists want(ed). Lots of people are being fooled. For all we know they were/are behind the rise of cryptocurrency this whole time."
"350","Ehhhgh... I kinda doubt it. The only we were fooled is if satoshi were the fed. And with the way the actual fed tried to hunt him, and with how much they have bashed bitcoin it would have to be some sort of really really deep conspiracy.... and they would have had to be exceptionally forward looking. 

Personally, I would discount the satoshi=fed theory. :\\ I think..."

As for the timing, I think a lot of people are overestimating how much most Democrats care about abortion, and underestimating how many ProLifers will be motivated to vote in national elections now that Republicans are actually pushing this sort of change."
"369","The issue is timing. Bad timing.

 Can be on the right side of every single issue but won't mean anything if the Democrats keep control of both houses because they'll do the opposite of what Graham is proposing-they will federalize the right to abortion up until birth.

Got a state's right victory in the supreme court ruling on abortion. Work with that and spend efforts in those states that have liberal abortion laws not on a federal bill."

"488","Good. They pay taxes, they get the benefits of taxes."
"489","What taxes do illegals they pay?"
"490","The same taxes we all pay. If there is a discrepancy in their taxes, you should take issue with the scumbag tax dodger employing them under the table."
"491","How do they pay the same taxes I do if they don't have a social security number? You didn't explain anything."
"492","Again, it seems like your actual issue is with the company that is employing people under the table.

To directly answer your question though, they pay into the system but cannot receive benefits.

"493","Illegals and their children benefit much more by not paying taxes and use many of the tax payer funded government programs."
"494","Well, no. As we've already established, they do pay taxes but are ineligible to receive many of the benefits citizens may receive. The fee that actually are in a position of being paid under the table are the victims in this scenario. The culprits are the companies that willingly violate the law by not paying their taxes."
"495","Who has established that? Other pro illegals that twist their argument like a pretzel?"
"496","I've made the same straightforward argument this entire time. The only one twisting anything here is you with your sidestepping and ad hominems."
"497","Straight forward with no facts or legitimate source to back up your claim. >h"

"524","Trump predicted everything what we are experiencing right now: inflation, market crash, wasteful government spending, etc.
In terms of strengths of Trump, it was economy. At the time of his administration country we had positive GDP. He did not start wars. We did not have skyrocketing inflation.
Current administration has no strengths only failures in every single aspect."

"595","Biden will go down in history as the president who killed the most Americans from covid.

If he is at 400,000 Americans killed i can't even fathom how many more biden will kill."
"596","Come on, man!"
"597","Yup...."
"598","You know, the thing."
"599","Biden will forever be known as the president with the most covid deaths."
"600","Yea, like his entire career as a politician will go down as the biggest mistake to ever happen to US politics. They complained Trump was too mean. Yet our country flourished under him. It was the left and their media that took it upon themselves to stoke the flames of conflict. Everyone willing could have enjoyed Trumps economy and enjoyed their lives. But why let the Republicans win with such a horrible thing."
"601","Nobody who has a brain thinks people getting 2-3 minimum wage jobs to survive is flourishing

Nor is a few pennies on the dollar of wages 

Republicans touting what they think is fact always ends up being weak manbaby ego with some disingenuous altered reality smeared on top 

They cant win with facts so they just cheat and lie about everything now because their base has no standards to begin with"
"602","That wasnt the case under Trump lol. You dont have a clue. And if youre working minimum wage jobs, that sounds like maybe you need to expand your skill set beyond pouring coffee for snobs at Starbucks. 

Secondly, you think this inflation and lack of people wanting to go to work is better? Biden has crippled our economy. 

Under Trump, the country was way better off. And a lot of the Democrat voters see that now. 2022 and 2024 are going to be bad years for leftists.

You my friend live under a very very heavy rock."
"603","You dont seem to understand. 

Your cult applauded peasant wage penny increases and people needed multiple low wage jobs as a booming economy

People with brains see through that dogshit 

Youre always so weak, theres a reason Republicans have to lie"
"604","Thats not how it went lol. You calling people liars while youre actively lying is comical. Again, MINIMUM WAGE jobs are exactly that. Minimum. Sounds exactly like the type of effort leftists put into their every day lives. So its fitting. 

Expand your skill set and you wont be a McDonalds burger flipper or barista at a over priced coffee shop.

And before you start your cult accusations. Prove that youre not in a cult? Cause as of right now, youre exposing yourself as a mainstream media cultist."
"605","Im just stating the obvious fact and how Republicans tried to twist it into the economy doing well

Wage workers getting peasant increases and salaries barely keeping up with inflation if at all and people working multiple min wage jobs for food is not evidence of a flourishing economy

Youre desperate, disingenuous, and unable to observe the economy objectively"
"606","You're stating an uneducated opinion, not facts. Just because you lack the skills to land a job beyond minimum wage does not mean we should suffer inflation because you are too lazy to get an education. The wage increases under Trump were actually not a policy move, but rather the move of private corporations own doing. 

Companies did start paying more money while Trumps tax cuts also helped those working lower wage jobs. You are just ignorant on how economics works. You think simply raising the minimum wage will fix the issue. 

Answer this poopy pants supporter. What do you do when the cost of goods and services rise beyond the wage gap? Oh wait, it did. Inflation is up near 9%, meanwhile income has risen only 6%... So once again, the minimum wage hike did nothing because everything simply just got more expensive...

&amp;#x200B;

I urge you to get an education and put down the social media and fakes news."
"607","Its telling youd try to disparage people on minimum wage and also assume that everyone who objectively observes the blatant misclassification of meager min. wage increases and multiple jobs required for food with salaries not keeping up with inflation as a flourishing economy 

But thats what desperate people do. They lie about reality."
"608","Vaccine is out. What more do you want? Overwhelming majority of hospitalizations are not vaxxed. You want the president to force vaccination?  Sounds like a dictatorship to me"
"609","Democrats reported daily on covid deaths and now barely mention it.   

They are just being hypocritical as usual."
"610","Well, first, we might argue over the statement that the overwhelming majority are un vaxxed....

But, the main point is that no president, governor, or anyone can do anything to stop a natural disaster.   And those who believed him when he said he had a plan and would end covid are morons."
"611","I mean. How can he shut down the virus. When people are not willing to get the vaccine? Most of those deaths are from unvaccinated. 

Seriously, what do you think he should do to get rid of a virus that is killing people across the world and mutating?"
"612","Biden said he had a plan....

I can't help it if it isnt working.

Isnt it hypocritical not to blame biden as democrats continually blamed trump?"
"613","[removed]"
"614","Trump was pushing to develop the vaccine and democrats made it political.  They started it and now are acting surprised when vaccines are still political.

Biden is partisan and divisive.  He should be working on unity and governing for the people.....not just his party.

Also a majority are vaccinated so it isnt like the vaccine is very effective."

"648","Agreed, but I think it's VERY important that you go vote still. I know that the dems have been stealing elections, but they can't steal all of them. They have to do it in such a way that can leave some possibility of legitimacy, otherwise even the most apathetic citizen might wake up and do something. The Reps have gained so much momentum and support due to this joke/nightmare of an administration, that it'll be a massacre in the polls. The numbers will be so overwhelming they won't be able to credibly steal most of the elections out there.

That's why, even though the elections get stolen, it's still important to get out there and vote!"

"738","Im a Republican and even I know that the election wasnt rigged. I used to believe that in 2020 but then found out that it wasnt because it was confirmed multiple times by fact checkers and many news sources. I think Trump lost because the liberals complained about him so much for 4 years straight which caused him to lose votes. Its a shame Trump lost but I accept the results instead of claiming that Biden is not my president because first of all, I live in this country which makes him my president and second of all, saying not my president is no different than what the Democrats did in 2016 and I refuse to stoop down to their level and be a sore loser hypocrite like them.

"749","DeSantis 2024*"
"750","Lol, no."
"751","I don't know about deSantis,  but didn't DJT get five deferments for bone spurs from Dr. Braunstein? His daughters said his landlord, Fred Trump, did Dr. B favors, and other kids who were less rich served and died in the jungle.

On Memorial Day this is a bit ironic. Doesn't Ron have a cleaner service record? He went to Yale. What do you think?"
"752","I'm a results guy. And DJT had plenty."
"753","ME TOO, Brother!

 But my question was about this post.

Considering 45 got five deferments while working for his dad and making money, and on the subject of military, he hired Kelly (fired), McMaster (fired), Mattis (fired), and would have fired Milley if he could, I am wondering whether it's wise for us to be talking about trump as military guy. I mean, he could have served, right.? Maybe talk about him was a business guy.

the only general who survived was Flynn for like a month, but he got convicted. Taking secret money from the dictator Erdogan while reversing our Turkish policy, sitting next to Putin at the RT Dinner and the undercutting our sanctions policy and got caught lying about it on a wiretap.

Trump pardoned him. I agree: the man is a patriot, right?

I know George Washington mortgaged Mt. Vernon to pay the Continental Army. I could see Trump doing the same thing!!! He's that kind of guy. A real patriot!

PS: I also think that Trump was absolutely right to politely ask that rat Comey not to pursue charges against Flynn because Flynn was a good guy. 

In a democracy a president should get to decide who goes to jail and who doesn't. That's one reason we're so screwed up."

"831","So, Im definitely a fan of some of Musks work (particularly SpaceX, without which, America would effectively not have access to space right now), if not always of him as a person.  He is a brilliant businessman who has had multiple chances to sit back and enjoy a fortune, but has, instead, let it ride and sunk his time and money into new, highly speculative projects.  


That said, the guy just needs to learn when to SHUT UP.  Cheap, reliable access to space is vastly important for the future of America and humanity and there are a million ways, big and small, in which government can kill SpaceXs projects.  He needs to stop antagonizing the likes of Sanders and Warren, who are either too uninformed or too dishonest to understand the repercussions of what they are doing or how fundamentally different SpaceX is from other, superficially similar new space ventures that produce little but tourist flights and shiny graphics (mostly at taxpayer expense).


He's trying to outtroll the trolls.  Problem is, though, that these trolls have the power to smash his dreams in the real world if they get pissed enough or think that their bases will reward them for doing so."
"832","I really disagree. If he can't poke the bear then who can? I'm grateful that he makes them look foolish."
"833","Plenty of pundits, authors, and other personalities without his massive responsibilities can do so without risking (at a minimum) the jobs of tens of thousands of people and the investments of millions of others or, (at a maximum) America and humanity's future in space.  


But what point does it serve?  It gains him nothing.  It convinces nobody on the left to change their opinions.  All it does is serve as another exhibit of a billionaire acting childish.  It helps to build the consensus on the left (manufactured or not) that people like him need to be taxed out of existence and that SpaceX is another frivolous vanity project."

In fact the capital has been attacked a few times. I'm pretty sure it was a crime to burn down buildings. Destroyed innocent peoples property. Many people got killed. I guess the democrats had a good reason. And wonder why they're not burning things down now that the democrats are in. Same problem same police. Idk"
"894","The FBI director was appointed by Trump himself so thats not gonna fly.  You radical extremists are going to ruin our country. Seriously.  There is more to this than you think.  The world is going through serious change and the USA in in a position to survive and get stronger.  You extremists (including those on the far left) are the only ones who will make us crumble."
"895","Help me out what am I missing. what serious changes are happening in  the world. Besides China? Or the elites working towards globalization. Is globalization your goal? You want to depend on other countries for your  Necessities that you need live? Idk help me"
"896","What will happen is de-globalization weather we want it or not.  Supply chain disruptions are just the beginning. China and Europe will not do well but we will if we keep it together and stay united.  Trump is a divider, he is chaotic, and lets be real, he is grossly unqualified to deal with it."
"897","U believe im climate change? I'm old enough to have lived through 5 different times that we were told had world destruction climate changes. Im still here. The oceans where supposed to raise and kill us all 20 yrs ago.  You know the information you look up is like The Bible. If you can find whatever information you want to solidify your beliefs.  I like to go with history. That's why we shouldn't destroy our history.  hard not to make the same mistakes. If you forgot the mistakes that were made."
"898","I think were talking about 2 completely different subjects.  I never mentioned climate change nor did I mention the Bible.  History is being destroyed? I honestly have no idea what youre talking about."
"899","Well, if they can provide enough evidence to a judge, then my home will be raided and evidence taken. Thats how it works. In America, no one is above the law. No one.  Not even insurrectionist ex presidents."

"905","I think the real reason that tptb are paid to support abortion is because of sales of fetal body parts.  supposedly the average fetus parts is worth about $43,000 and roughly 620,000 babies are aborted every year so that makes $26.6 billion dollars. Obviously every fetus isnt going to be viable or sold but this is the size of the industry.  Also grant money for ""research"" will be part of the industry also and profit from the procedures that use the parts.  I think this is the real secret reason for the support of the abortion industry"
"906","It's not a secret, people just don't care.  They also don't care that planned parenthood is the life long project of Margaret Sanger, who was a,genocidal white supremacist who wanted to use abortion against blacks like Hitler used gas chambers against jews.  Her dream has come true.  Planned parenthood has killed 4 times as many healthy black babies as Hitler killed jews."
"907","Its said that Hitler himself wrote a letter to Margaret Sanger and wad praising her work and was saying how much he liked her.  But Republicans are the ones thats racist."
"908","Even Mitt Romney recognized the increasingly vague reasons for abortion when he was running for Prez."
"909","Here is another: Doesn't matter. 

It's a proven scientific fact that societies without high infant mortality rates either via natural causes or population controls, ie abortion, will experience increased and out of control population booms. The consequences of a society than ban abortions are detrimental to the future continuance of that society.

"911","I would like to remind Republicans that this country is not a Christian Nation nor is it supposed to only support any one religion. There are laws against Religion in our schools which Christians want to abolish. So in my eyes Christian Republicans are just as bad as the Democrats they are totally ignoring why our Founding Fathers formed this Nation."
"912","Yes. The Supreme Court decision doesnt mention Christianity once."
"913","You don't have to be a Christian to see that ripping a 9 month old healthy baby from it's mother's womb, poisoning  then dismembering it, is wrong."
"914","What are you even going on about? Show me the 9 month old, healthy fetus that was aborted. Hell, less than 1% of abortions are after 6 months."
"915","Then why are you throwing a hissie fit to make it legal?"
"916","Because some states made it illegal to even abort a 2 week old fetus?"

"1042","That was a Democratic issue. They will get celebrated while I am surprised you didnt get banned for your post. It is Republican in nature and I always get banned for my Republican posts. 

Also to RebelMountainman you must be mistaken. We dont whine. We voice our opinion.

"1050","You should look up the definition of that word, because you show a strong misunderstanding."
"1051","Well Republicans what do you expect when all you do is whine and complain. You are all talk but no action"
"1052","Did they force their way in, or were they allowed in? How many of them broke into chambers or into the main floor?"
"1053","Nope, just came into a pre-planned protest with cute pink shirts =
 and without stated intent to harm or kill.  Plus, theyre not delusional, just rationally furious."
"1054","Democrats set the precident that it doesn't matter either way."
"1055","How so? What did they do that made those details not matter?"
"1056","Arrested people on jan6th who were nonviolent and let in."
"1057","Only a moron would have thought it was ok to go because they were let in, especially in the spots where there was active violence against the 140 or so officers injured"
"1058","Get out of your head"
"1059","They were let in to the House Chamber? They didn't break any windows or barriers to get in? They were legally in the building and weren't trespassing? They didn't destroy property? They were invited in to the senators offices?"
"1060","Not all that were arrested.

Nice try moving the goal post when you know you are wrong."
"1061","Moving what goal post? Not a single person here did anything illegal. There were most definitely people doing illegal things on Jan 6. While you can argue that some were arrested without sufficient cause, you certainly can't say that everyone that was arrested was without cause. If they are legally protesting here, and they didn't break in they were legally allowed in, you have no argument. No need to move any goal posts, they are safely cemented in the ground. 

If enough of these people started trying to break in to the building and the police have lost control of the situation, then sure arrest them all and sort it out later. I have no problem with that. If you want to say that is the precedent, then I'm fine with that. But that is not happening here. False equivalence."
"1062","I never said that though.

Hence you moving the goal post."
"1063","I'm telling you it's not the same situation, there were no people doing anything illegal. You can't compare the two situations. I gave you an example that is something you could compare. If you want to say I moved the goal posts, then I will say your goal posts weren't even in the stadium to begin with. That's what a false equivalence is, you based your argument on an event that was not equivalent to this one at all."
"1064","So in one case people weren't violent but were arrested and in another people weren't violent and were not arrested.

You have a good point in that is the difference."
"1065","An insurrection is by definition violent. Those protests in Wisconsin were just exerting their freedom of speech and freedom to rally at the designated places within the Capitol building. I don't think any laws were broken, nothing was broken and no one died or got injured."

"1075","Republicans need to do more than vote. They need to nominate the right candidates and get to work backing whoever wins the nomination. Whether that's fundraising, door to door or social media campaigning etc. We can't just snap our fingers and hope to win because some polls say Biden is unpopular."
"1076","And we must vote in Larger than life numbers. Inundate the polls, so to stop any possible steals from re-occurring."
"1077","We need to stop talking about stolen elections because 1. It turns off middle of the road voters who don't like Trump but do like Republicans and 2. It depresses Republican voters because if the election will be stolen why bother voting. 

I'm not saying we shouldn't discuss electoral reform. We should support picture ID to vote and other voting reforms that are anti-fraud. Talking about that is fine, proposing legislation is fine. Claiming Trump won doesn't help the Republicans and it only hurts us going forward. 2020 is over, we have midterms to win now."
"1078","I get mad because I am a Republican doesnt mean I will vote trump. Doesnt mean I am pro-life. As a Republican I also see the immediate need for senate and congressional term limits. I think that those both Republican and Democratic in office are sitting pretty on the backs and labors of their constituents and living large while those in their districts suffer. I want to see my States Republicans and Democrats senators and congress people replaced. They have been there too long. All of them. They have made a living off of the office. That is not in the American peoples best interest. They live large and well. Not in Pelosis state but her bragging on having ice cream with her 3 $30,000.00 fridge/frezeers in her kitchen. Why is that allowed?  I think term limits need to be established to keep the elected honest and true. That way they have 4 years to prove their worth 4 more. If they dont prove it elect someone else. 

Now it is no one will run against the big man because they cant win due to the man having backing by big money. If we implemented term limits.  The backing would be for new people and the public would be able to determine who was true and who was a paid hand. 

Who else feels this way?  Republicans and Democrats?  I want to know?"

"1160","TLDR:   
Trump's Executive Order frozen, not revoked. And it would have affected a limited amount of people, and was opposed by the people who would enact it as inefficient and costly.   
Build Back Better caps insulin cost for all public and private insurance holders.  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The executive order, which was signed by Trump on July 24, 2020, was frozen, not revoked.  Such a freeze is also not unusual for an incoming administration: Trumps chief of staff Reince Priebus issued a similar memorandum on January 20, 2017. If implemented, it will require that Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) -- which serve about one in 11 Americans, including homeless and vulnerable populations -- offer the discounted price they receive when they purchase insulin and injectable epinephrine (EpiPens) through a federal program called 340B. The freeze was welcomed by the National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC).  Health centers are already part of the solution to this problem, and the regulation would have burdened them with excessive red tape without doing anything to lower how much drug companies charge for drugs. Such a rule could decrease the amount of money available for other services.

  
Among the Build Back Better bill's many drug price provisions is one that would set a $35 monthly cap on insulin for Medicare beneficiaries and those with private insurance."
"1161","Why is Biden taking full credit?"
"1162","Why freeze it and wait a year to address it....terrible leadership."

Fast forward to every election since and I still get a ballot in the mail from CO& delivered to my home address.. in another state. Even for local town matters like mayor and bocc.

"1383","Honest question:  What would Trump have done differently?  Or is this based on the old Madman Theory that Russia wouldn't do it because they didn't know what Trump would do?


The best course of action would probably have been to coordinate and publish a response with NATO ahead of time, promising and positioning massive material aid, ready to go, if Russia invaded.  While I agree with Trump's basic point that many of the NATO members weren't paying their fair share, he wasn't exactly in a position to coordinate with them."
"1384","Trump did everything differently than Joe Biden. So to answer your question it would be more oil. We can start with oil production, with Trump in office the United States would be a net exporter of oil and natural gas. The price globally would have been lower than the $100 a barrel that is funding Putin's war. Now Russia holds the cards because they have the oil so no one can do anything. So that in a nutshell my friend is why things would be different"
"1385","First off trump turned down the pipe line that went to Europe know it would hurt Europe to be dependent on Russian oil and gas and then the keystone pipe would allow the usa to export are oil and gas so naturally Biden decided to stop the usa pipeline and approve the Russian one plus Biden weak pull out of Afghanistan proved that he was weak."

He has a unique ability of getting in his own way and pissing off moderates and swing voters (especially suburban women).  I dont think Biden won in 2020 as much as Trump lost.  

I think Desantis will be a very good president.  I think he is the real deal conservative leader that can pull a lot of swing votes.  I have been waiting for a leader like Desantis for a long time.  My fear is that if Trump gets back in the WH he will further unite the Left and make it harder for Desantis to get elected down the road.

"1508","Exactly. I dont see the point in judging ppl for this, let them do their thing. We have a flag but dont have it up in front of our house, or anywhere for that matter. But Im sure we will use it at some point in some way with the way things are escalating! I will say conservatives are FED UP. I live in Parker and if you head east there are so many of these flags/signs. And if youre near the Kansas/Colorado border there is a Giant flag about the size of a semi truck!"

Theyre releasing it now cuz they think the normies are too preoccupied with ukraine to notice or care.

The people on this subreddit main concern should be the midterm elections first and foremost.

"1641","Its crazy how obvious it is that lockdowns and stimulus checks caused the inflation we are seeing today yet literally nobody on either side of the aisle will point to that&. Probably because both parties are guilty"
"1642","A lot of people know that inflation was due to overprinted money and lockdowns. Of course there are other factors. Mistake is, youre expecting the internet people to be smart enough to know. But lets be real, Bidens administration is at fault."
"1643","Biden, Trump, democrats, republicans& theres plenty of blame to go around."
"1644","Trump left Biden a 1.4% inflation and good economy. Biden shut down domestic energy production and canceled the keystone pipeline. That had a ripple effect. This is on the current administration."
"1645","You just said that its also due to lockdowns and stimulus checks. Which is it then?

Both have their hand in the honey pot. Inflation doesnt happen overnight, it takes months and years for the effects of a nation wide lockdown to have negative effects on the economy. The lockdowns and stimulus checks happened under trumps watch. Bidens lack of action to incentivize domestic oil production exacerbated the effects."
"1646","Trump approved only 1 round of stimulus and wanted to open the economy back up. Biden enacted 2 more payments. And then kept lockdowns/mandates in place while simultaneously destroying our domestic energy production."
"1647","You need to check your facts. There were multiple stimulus checks under trump. During his campaign in 2020 he even promised to increase the payout for the next round of checks if he was elected. Why blindly defend politicians like this? I dont get it."
"1648","Youre correct. The 2nd check was only $600. Them Biden took over and did it again instead of opening the economy."
"1649","Yep and if trump had his way, the third check would have been $2000 as per his campaign promise."
"1650","With the economy open. That makes the difference. Democrats shut out economy down for too long and tried to create a separate class of workers thru illegal mandates. Biden also cut off our domestic energy production. Which is a huge problem with our inflation. People dont seem to understand that cutting off our production is a killing blow to any economy."

By blaming President Trump they are really telling the public that they do not want to solve the crisis because it was they who created the crisis. They blame President Trump so the legal U.S. citizens in this country can go through as much hurt and damage as possible from the two crises. A smaller tax base does hurt the people who stay in California.

This is really the hallmark of democratic politicians. They absolutely refuse to feel the pain of the people they represent. Lightfoot is another perfect example of this. Their reliance on a rigged election process gives them the confidence they need to destroy the lives of the legal citizens of this country and ignore the pain their party inflicts on their constituents."

In the last 9 years US police [raped](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2018/10/19/us/police-sexual-assaults-maryland-scope/index.html) over 400 people in custody.

In 2017 police killed [1000](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/nationwide-police-shot-and-killed-nearly-1000-people-in-2017/2018/01/04/4eed5f34-e4e9-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html%3foutputType=amp)  people in the US.

&gt;Police officers are indicted in fewer than 1% of killings, but the indictment rate for civilians involved in a killing is 90%. (FiveThirtyEight)

&gt;In 2015, there were 1,307 people who lost their lives at the hands of a police officer or law enforcement official. In 2016, that number was 1,152. Although lower, both years are still higher than the 1,149 people who were killed by police in 2014. (Fatal Encounters/Mapping Police Violence

&gt;52% of police officers report that it is not unusual for law enforcement officials to turn a blind eye to the improper conduct of other officers. (US Department of Justice)

&gt;61% of police officers state that they do not always report serious abuse that has been directly observed by fellow officers. (US Department of Justice)

&gt;84% of police officers have stated in a recent survey that they have directly witnesses a fellow officer using more force than was necessary. (US Department of Justice)

&gt;People who are African-American/Black are twice as likely to be killed by a police officer while being unarmed compared to a Caucasian/White individual. (The Guardian)

&gt;1 in 4 people who are killed by law enforcement officials in the United States are unarmed. (Mic)

&gt; The second most common form of police misconduct is sexual assault

&gt;This isn't debatable, actually look at the facts](https://www.vox.com/identities/2016/8/13/17938186/police-shootings-killings-racism-racial-disparities)

&gt;An analysis of the available FBI data by [Dara Lind for Vox](http://www.vox.com/2014/8/21/6051043/how-many-people-killed-police-statistics-homicide-official-black) found that US police kill black people at disproportionate rates: Black people accounted for 31 percent of police killing victims in 2012, even though they made up just 13 percent of the US population. 

&gt;The disparities appear to be even starker for unarmed suspects, according to an analysis of 2015 police killings by the [Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/black-americans-killed-by-police-analysis). Racial minorities made up about 37.4 percent of the general population in the US and 46.6 percent of armed and unarmed victims, but they made up 62.7 percent of unarmed people killed by police.

&gt;These disparities in police use of force reflect more widespread racial inequities across the entire American criminal justice system. Black people are much more likely to be [arrested for drugs](http://www.vox.com/cards/war-on-drugs-marijuana-cocaine-heroin-meth/war-on-drugs-effect), even though theyre not more likely to [use](http://www.vox.com/2014/7/27/5940783/prohibition-marijuana-legalization-pot-weed-racism-new-york-times) or [sell](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2871399/) them. And black inmates make up a disproportionate amount of the [prison population](http://www.vox.com/cards/everything-prisons-reform-incarceration-criminal-justice/what-are-the-demographics-of-the-prison-population).


[Another study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0141854)

&gt;from 2015, by researcher Cody Ross found, There is no relationship between county-level racial bias in police shootings and crime rates (even race-specific crime rates), meaning that the racial bias observed in police shootings in this data set is not explainable as a response to local-level crime rates. That suggests that, again, other factors are involved in the disparities seen for these shootings."

"1873","How is this different from the National Guard?"
"1874","National guard is partially if not mostly federally funded and answer to the president if he calls on them directly, still an arm of the US army. A purely state militia would have no federal allegiance. I believe that's how it works and differs in a nut shell."
"1875","Kinda sounds like the state police, but I see your point."
"1876","Yeah basically, but more military like training and equipment, with little civic responsibility or authority. The main point is to remove the federal government entirely and have an exclusively state run national gaurd, so the federal executive branch has no authority whatsoever"
"1877","This is pretty much correct. They are like a reserve to the National Guard and only under state control. So if the National Guard needs assistance or natural disasters occur etc, the State Guard would fill that role."
"1878","I don't think this is a great idea. Imagine if it was a democrat in office with a personal army to Send around harassing people and business. Republicans wont hold office forever. Lets not set this precedent."
"1879","California, New York, Illinois, and several other states already have something similar to this"
"1880","Sounds too reminiscent of brown shirts or secret police."
"1881","Just because someone does not understand the normal uses and the long history of State Defense Forces does not make them the SS, Nazis, Brown Shirts, or any other flavor of facism exaggeration. Nearly half of states maintain state guard units, both blue and red."
"1882","It's unnecessary, and seems ripe for misuse."
"1883","I'm not really sure what sort of misuse you expect to happen exactly. They have existed and continue to operate in many states, again both blue and red, and have for a long time without issue. They are a good augmenting force to National Guard units, which deploy every now and then. State Guard units do not deploy and do not have National responsibilities, so their help can be quite neccesary to individual states. Even during WW2, when our military was far more expansive than it is now, State Guards were a vital resource for when NG units, which were getting deployed, had to go overseas. 

It should also be noted that in the same speech, DeSantis was announcing major investments in the Florida National Guard as well."
"1884","22 states have them, in addition to Puerto Rico. Usually they just do non-combat military duties such as disaster response, band, honor guard, maritime patrol, stuff like that."
"1885","Wow, what a nothing burger. Its known as a state militia, and 22 states (+Puerto Rico) have them. I dont understand how this is newsworthy&"
"1886","There is a reason you separate the military and the police.  One fights the enemies of the state, the other serves and protects the people.  When the military becomes both, then the enemies if the state tend to become the people.

"1901","Canadian here, few major differences.

1. We generally all have a government issued ID in the form of our health card.

2. The list of forms of acceptable voter ID is extremely extensive. Basically any id issued by any government agency, including a library card, is acceptable.

3. You dont actually need an id as long as you get somebody with an id to vouch for you.

If Republicans proposed voter id laws along the lines of that framework, it might actually get passed. Instead we see things like the North Carolina attempt, where there was a documented deliberate effort to exclude certain types of ids based on the race / political affiliation of the typical holder. 

Also, voter id laws do nothing to stop mail in voting fraud, which is what everybody is complaining about.

Finally, I think the idea that the government needs a really good reason to limit your ability to engage in a constitutional right really friggin cool. Its why Im against a lot of feel-good not actually helpful gun legislation. The idea that the government would inconvenience everybody to stop a problem they cant show really exists by implementing laws that wouldnt actually stop that problem is pretty lame of you guys."

****Minimum Age for Gun Possession: Subject to limited exceptions*, federal law prohibits the possession of a handgun or handgun ammunition by any person under the age of 18. Federal law provides no minimum age for the possession of long guns or long gun ammunition.*****

Hmmmm. I guess I was wrong about the federal law? 

Federal law provides no minimum age for the possession of long guns or long gun ammunition ARE YOU KIDDING ME? a 10yo kid can possess a rifle or shotgun and its not against federal law?

But what does the STATE law say? 

Children over 12 and under 16 are allowed to use rifles and shotguns under very limited, supervised situations.[11]

They totally skipped 17? There's no info here about 17, you're still one year away from legally buying it yourself?

I guess we can assume it's OK bc it's not listed or vague-ish.

Seems to be a grey area...... I guess that's why the judge dismissed the gun charges.


Under Wisconsin law, anyone under 18 who possesses a dangerous weapon is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to nine months behind bars.


Uh oh! 

But Rittenhouses attorneys seized on a subsection of the Wisconsin law that states the ban on minors possessing dangerous weapons applies to minors armed with rifles or shotguns only if those weapons are short-barreled. The language stems from a bill that then-Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson signed in 1991. Lawmakers across the country were trying to find ways to curb gang violence around that time. Kenosha defense attorney Michael Cicchini said the law was likely intended to prevent youths from carrying sawed-off shotguns.

Rittenhouses AR-15-style rifle was not short-barreled.

LOOPHOLE! GOT LUCKY!"
"1990","It does not say anyone under 18 who possesses a dangerous weapon is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to nine months behind bars. It says This section applies only to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a rifle or a shotgun if the person is in violation of s. 941.28 or is not in compliance with ss. 29.304 and 29.593. This section applies only to an adult who transfers a firearm to a person under 18 years of age if the person under 18 years of age is not in compliance with ss. 29.304 and 29.593 or to an adult who is in violation of s. 941.28. So if your not in violation of those subsections no law was broken."
"1991","There is an exception for hunting that is poorly worded, which essentially lowers the legal age of possession to 17.  Because of this, the judge dismissed it.  As the law is written, a 17 year old can legally possess a firearm.

https://www.wisconsinrightnow.com/2021/11/13/kyle-rittenhouse-gun-charge/"
"1992","Thats owning, possession is different"
"1993","The person you are explaining it to won't know the difference. Not like he watched the trial or anything and would know that the defense, prosecution, and judge all agreed he couldn't legally have the firearm and that it was a straw purchase. Not like Dominick Black is going to trial over that or anything. Oh wait he is"
"1994"," The judge was definitely not in agreement because he dismissed the gun charges!"
"1995","He literally said he dropped it because of the ambiguous law and how poorly it was written. Did you watch the trial? The Judge literally said that and feel on the side of leniency and again all parties agreed he was violating in the interpretation that literally almost every other state has."
"1996","Well apparently there's something in the Wisconsin State law that says 17 year olds are not allowed to carry a rifle or shotgun if it has a short barrel. The fine print in there and I did another post about it here I think somewhere the fine print says that the law refers to short-barreled rifles in short barreled shotguns and because his Barrel was regular length it didn't apply to him. Kyle."
"1997","You are summarizing it incorrectly. The issue was the law shouldn't have allowed a 17 year old to carry a rifle or shotgun without oversight. Because of the word ""and"" and a "";"" the defense basically got to argue that the first part of the statute didn't refer to hunting even though it was nested inside of a hunting law code. Kyle barely scooted by again because the Judge said it was written poorly and was ambiguous. The SBR part and the other referenced statutes just made the problem even worse."
"1998","So basically, you're saying he broke the law because YOU think it should have been illegal?"
"1999","If that's what you got from that your brain is so smooth we need to use it for bowling."
"2000","""The issue was the law shouldn't have allowed a 17 year old to carry a rifle or shotgun without oversight""

The word shouldn't makes it an opinion and opinions are not laws. He didn't break the actual law, he broke what you think the law should have been."

"2013","Agree. Free speech means that you can say whatever you want to. That does NOT mean that any forum or platform is required to air your speech. All forums and platforms are subject to rules. Rules that  may be influenced by a wide array of people or powers including yes the government. That's not covered under free speech. Facebook is under no obligation to give your speech air time. If you sent an opinion into the New York Times you could not claim it was a violation of free speech when they chose not to print it. Free speech guarantees only that you can say or write whatever crazy idiotic or heinous thing you want but it does not require any other person or party to print or publish what you say."

: We specifically wanted to work with public health experts to understand the difference between information and behavior, and so we did consult with the CDC, World Health Organization, and others to understand how the platform policeis we built were effecting public health.


So yeah Facebook worked with the government to learn what info was accurate about Covid. The government did not force Facebook to take anything down. Facebook has the right to take down whatever they want.


Youre missing that part. I wonder why??"
